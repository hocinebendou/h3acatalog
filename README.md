H3Africa Catalogue is a java-spring project with neo4j graph database. The h3acatalog is a central repository for data coming
from the archive and the biobanks. The Archive data consist of bioinformatics studies done by the H3Africa member nodes, 
and the biobanks data are information of the samples used in the studies.

## Archive
